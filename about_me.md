## About Me
On the market PhD candidate at UC Irvine's [Criminology, Law & Society](https://cls.soceco.uci.edu/pages/phd-program) program with an emphasis in Race and Justice. I have been recognized with the 2023-24 Haynes Dissertation Fellowship, the 2022-23 [National Collaborative on Gun Violence Research Dissertation Award](https://www.ncgvr.org/grants/2022/assessing-the-causes-of-gun-desirability-in-america.html), the 2022-23 UC Irvine Public Impact Fellowship, and the 2018-23 Social Ecology Arnie Binder Fellowship. I perform fieldwork and manage datasets for the [Shadow Costs](https://www.shadowcosts.com) project, which tests the impact of rehabilitation classes and monetary sanctions (with funding by NSF, NIJ, RSF, and Haynes grants). Additionally, I am an active member of the [Irvine Laboratory for the Study of Space and Crime](http://ilssc.soceco.uci.edu/).

## Service
In my professional service I review for [the American Sociological Review and Criminology](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0955-1031), and have served as an Editorial Assistant for Sociological Perspectives. My service to UC Irvine includes work as a Peer Mentor and Graduate Representative for the Criminology, Law & Society department, and as a Graduate Representative to the School of Social Ecology. In my service to the community, I provide statistics tutoring for inmates at California State Prison Solano, consult with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and work with the Federal Defenders of the 1st Circuit.

## Prior Experience and Interests
Before academia, I built models and developed strategies for technology and infrastructure companies as a consultant and data analyst. I earned my bachelors in 2014 at Harvard - with a major in [Social Studies](https://socialstudies.fas.harvard.edu/) and minor in Psychology - and wrote a senior thesis on how police and gun owners idealized gun ownership.

Outside of work, I enjoy culinary experiments (like creating my own [beef jerky recipe](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14g3BNcLFfN2xKgDRqwK4-0S1jt4SJRSaw_OR_8raQ0g/edit?usp=sharing)), being active, and the challenge of mastering progressive metal drum parts.
