I research security-seeking behaviors like gun ownership and how the criminal justice system interacts with inequality. I use preregistered experiments (forced-choice conjoint and vignette), longitudinal designs (smartphone-delivered surveys), semi-structured interviews, participant observation, and content analysis techniques like topic modeling. Active projects include:

1.  Evaluating the [Shadow Costs](https://www.shadowcosts.com/) of reentry, diversion, and rehabilitation treatment programs
2.  Investigating how socioeconomic hardship affects desire for guns
3.  Critiquing theories of neoliberalism
4.  Assessing how gun ownership affects neighborhood socialization
